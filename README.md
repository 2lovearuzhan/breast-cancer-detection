# Breast Cancer Detection
This project develops a Breast Cancer Detection model using Logistic Regression. The goal is to classify tumors as benign (0) or malignant
(1) based on 30 features such as radius, texture, smoothness and etc. The model achieves high accuracy by standardizing the features and
using supervised machine learning techniques.

Key steps:
1. Dataset preparation and pre-processing
2. Model training
3. Performance metrics

As a result, this Logistic Regression model provides an effective approach for breast cancer detection, demonstrating high accuracy and recall, 98% and 100% respectively.
